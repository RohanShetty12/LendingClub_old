# EDA for Lending Club Case Study

## Introduction
We have a company which is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. 

## Business Objective
Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (Credit Loss) i.e borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. The company wants to understand the driving factors behind loan default so that they can evaluate these parameters in the loan application and effectively decide if they can Approve or Reject loan

## Problem Statement
Whenever the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

We need to analyze the dataset provided by the company and perform an Exploratory Data Analysis to highlight the list of driving factors which influence the possibility of an applicant repay the loan or defaulting on it.
